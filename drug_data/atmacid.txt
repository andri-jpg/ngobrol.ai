Deskripsi: Atmacid is an antacid and anti-gas medication used to relieve symptoms of excess stomach acid, such as heartburn, nausea, bloating, and chest burning. It contains antacids, namely aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide, which work by neutralizing stomach acid. Simethicone or dimethicone is also included in Atmacid to relieve bloating by combining small gas bubbles in the digestive tract for easier expulsion through flatulence or burping. Atmacid is available in chewable tablet and suspension forms.
