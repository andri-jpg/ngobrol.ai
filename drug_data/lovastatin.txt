deskripsi: Lovastatin is a medication used to lower triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels while increasing HDL cholesterol levels in the blood. It belongs to the statin class of cholesterol-lowering drugs and works by inhibiting the enzyme involved in cholesterol production in the liver. By reducing the levels of LDL cholesterol, lovastatin helps prevent blockages in the blood vessels caused by cholesterol buildup. It is commonly used in patients at high risk of angina pectoris, heart attacks, or strokes. Lovastatin is available in tablet form and should only be taken with a doctor's prescription. It is recommended to combine lovastatin treatment with a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a low-fat diet, for optimal effectiveness.
